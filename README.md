# table manager program

This is a simple web app that will be used to store tables of information.

## running

The app can be set up locally by installing dependencies with `npm install` and then running the server with `npm start`.  This will create a local web server on port 8080.

If you want to use Gulp to monitor for changes and recompile the Typescript use `npm run watch`.  This also copies the index page over.
